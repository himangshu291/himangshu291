## Projects

I love working on exciting projects that challenge and improve my skills. Here are some of the notable projects I have worked on:

### 1. Billing software - python tkinter module

- Designed and developed a user-friendly billing software utilizing Python's tkinter GUI, enabling seamless bill generation and customization.
- Implemented advanced functionality for printing and saving bills directly from the application, optimizing efficiency and reducing manual effort.
- Utilized file handling techniques to ensure secure and organized storage of generated bills, enhancing data accessibility and management.

### 2. Educational Management System - JSP, Java, HTML, CSS, Apache Tomcat Web Server
            
This JSP-based system employs an Oracle database backend, offering three portals for
Admins, Students, and Teachers. Admins manage teacher and student data. Students
access personal details, while Teachers monitor student progress. The system enhances
educational administration and communication.

### 3. Resume Template Builder - JSP, iText Library, Java, HTML, Apache Tomcat Web Server

I designed a user-friendly project that simplifies the process of creating a resume. Users
can input their details, and the project will dynamically generate visually appealing
resume templates based on user inputs. This saves time as the project automates the
resume creation process. Additionally, the project provides design guidance for users that
are unfamiliar with formatting, allowing them to focus on the content rather than layout
and formatting. Finally, the project enables users to download their resumes in PDF
format for easy sharing and printing.

### 4. ATM machine project - Java OOPS Concept
            
This ATM machine project allows users to perform basic banking operations. Users can
securely access their accounts by entering a correct PIN. They have the option to deposit
funds, check their account balance, and withdraw money. The project provides a userfriendly interface for a seamless banking experience.
